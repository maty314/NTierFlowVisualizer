# NTierFlowVisualizer
A tool that visualizes the flow of requests in a multi-tier architecture. Using Nginx as a web load balancer and HAProxy for database load balancing, it distributes traffic across multiple application servers and MongoDB databases. Deployed with Docker, its web interface shows the real-time path of each request.
